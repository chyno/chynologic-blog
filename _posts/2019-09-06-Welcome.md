This is my first blog site.  This is my documentation of me journey to build my TV fantasy site.  This is my notes to help me reference what I am working on and help me learn by writing down what I am doing.  Hopefully this will be of use to someone else.

These are the technologies I am focusing on.
- Elm
- Fauna DB
- Block Chain Technologies - Ethereum and Smart Contracts
- Graph GQL
- AWS

Currently the goal is to build a site where users compete to choose the most successful shows on TV.  It is like a fantasy football league but for TV shows.  I will blog more about the User requirements later.

I would love to make this a joint effort so if interested in any of these technologies check it out and make a PR.
